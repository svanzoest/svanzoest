### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sander van Zoest. I am a technologist, entrepreneur and have worked on and with Open Source for over 25 years.
I am the founder and co-organizer of [San Diego DevOps](https://www.sddevops.org/). 


I have had my hand in a variety of things over the last few years, where most of that is better described on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/svanzoest), but some articles and talks are linked below.
